  "longDescription" : "The Sony PlayStation VR Headset for the PS4 is the first gaming VR headset for the PlayStation 4. On launch, it released with a huge range of VR games and this is set to grow. The PlayStation VR brings virtual reality to life in an accessible way and the headset is comfortable to wear, immersing you in the game.<br><br>360 degrees of VR<br>One of the core features of the PlayStation VR is that you can turn around 180 degrees and you will be facing backwards. It may not sound impressive, but it is a feature rarely found in VR headsets and it means that you can enjoy 360 degrees of movement within PlayStation VR games. This adds to the immersion factor of the game because you can see what is behind you and interact fully with your environment. The 3D audio also emulates 360 degrees of sound, so you can pinpoint exactly where footsteps, rustles and noises are coming from.<br><br>Built with everyone in mind<br>The PlayStation VR headset has been designed with all kinds of users in mind. At its heart is a design that aims to make the headset as immersive and yet as unnoticeable as possible. This means the headset slips on easily, is fully adjustable via a headband for all different sizes and is comfortable even during extended gaming sessions. The headset has minimal weight, so you won't feel fatigued from wearing it. Note: The PlayStation VR headset is not for use by children under 12.<br><br>Next-gen resolution<br>The 5.7inch OLED screen provides a full HD experience with a 100-degree viewing angle. The inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope can tell when you move, and the lights on the side of the headset ensure all of your movements are tracked accurately and translated into the game. The PlayStation VR experience also includes a special Movie mode, where you can watch movies on the headset and it will provide you with a cinema-like experience.<br><br>The VR accessory extras you need<br>The PlayStation VR requires the PlayStation Camera to work. This is sold separately. PlayStation Move is also sold separately and can enhance your gameplay on compatible games. You need the PlayStation 4 Console to play PlayStation VR games. All PlayStation VR games can be played with a DualShock 4 controller, included with the PlayStation 4.",
