Since the release of the PS4? in 2013, Sony® has been hard at work creating an even more powerful system for gaming. Made with the gamer in mind, the PS4? Pro has twice the amount of power compared to the standard PS4? and is the leader of the next-generation consoles in this regard. The cutting edge internal hardware gives the PS4? Pro the ability to stream games in full 4K with compatible TVs, and with PlayStation® virtual reality (VR) it takes the VR gaming visuals up to a whole new level. This version comes with a large 1TB hard drive, giving you lots of space to store your games, music and apps. With its sleek, slim design and intuitive interface, you?ll be in love the moment you get it in your hands.</p><p></p><p><h2>The next generation of console gaming</h2></p><p>With powerful Ultra HD gameplay capabilities and 3D and Blu-ray built in, the PS4?
